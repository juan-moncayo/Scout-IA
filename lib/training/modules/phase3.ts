"I'm worried about my rates going up"

**Rebuttal:**
Hail damage is an Act of God and doesn't count individually against policyholders. However, insurance companies may raise area premiums as a whole due to catastrophic events. You could potentially see a rate increase even without filing, simply because neighbors are filing claims. It's also important to consider long-term costs. Damage worsens over time, resulting in more extensive and expensive repairs.`,

"I'm not sure the damage is severe enough"

**Rebuttal:**
It's challenging to assess full damage extent without a professional inspection. Even minor damage can lead to serious issues over time. It's best to have it assessed by a qualified professional.

**Objection:**
"I'd rather pay out of pocket"

**Rebuttal:**
You've been paying for insurance precisely for situations like this. Filing a claim helps ensure you receive the coverage you've been paying for and offsets the financial burden.`
